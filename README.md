# AI Coding Buddy

AI Coding Buddy is an AI-powered coding assistant built to help beginners
understand their code instead of just getting answers.

## What is this project?

This project allows users to paste their code and receive:
- Clear explanations of what the code does
- Beginner-friendly explanations of errors
- Concept-based hints instead of full solutions

The goal is to encourage learning and problem-solving.

## Problem Statement

Beginner programmers often struggle with:
- Understanding error messages
- Knowing why their code works or fails
- Depending too much on complete solutions

This slows down learning and builds poor coding habits.

## Proposed Solution

AI Coding Buddy explains code and errors in simple language and provides
hints that guide users toward the solution without directly giving it.

## Features

Phase 1:
- Code explanation
- Error explanation (Python / C / JavaScript)
- Simple and beginner-friendly responses

Phase 2:
- Hint-only mode
- Concept explanations (loops, conditionals, functions)
- Difficulty selector (Beginner / Intermediate)

Phase 3:
- User accounts
- History of queries
- Learning progress tracking

## Tech Stack

Frontend:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or React)

Backend:
- Node.js or Python

AI:
- API-based language model

Version Control:
- Git and GitHub

## Project Status

This project is under active development with regular commits and updates.

## Learning Goals

Through this project, I aim to learn:
- Frontend and backend integration
